The Taj Mahal's story begins with the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan and his beloved wife, Mumtaz Mahal.

Completed in 1648, the Taj Mahal required the meticulous efforts of over 20,000 artisans, creating a testament to both love and human dedication.

Draped in legends, it's said that the emperor intended to build a black marble counterpart across the Yamuna River, but was ultimately imprisoned by his son, Aurangzeb. Despite this, Shah Jahan spent his final days admiring the Taj from afar, enshrining his undying love. The centerpiece of Agra’s cultural identity, the Taj Mahal was declared a UNESCO World Heritage site, ensuring its preservation for future generations.

At the heart of this marvel lies a complex mix of engineering and creativity. The majestic dome rises high above the monument, flanked by four towering minarets that lean slightly outward. This ingenious design ensures the minarets would crumble away from the tomb in case of collapse, safeguarding the central structure.
