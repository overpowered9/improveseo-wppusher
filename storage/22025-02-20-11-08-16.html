Music is another powerful tool. Playing lively songs encourages movement while allowing children to express themselves freely through dance. This not only makes exercise fun but helps them develop a sense of rhythm and boosts their mood.

You can also incorporate simple challenges or rewards. For instance, set a goal like completing ten jumping jacks to become a "morning hero."
