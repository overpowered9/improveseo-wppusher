At its core, strategy in cricket is about playing a mental game as much as a physical one. Imagine a chessboard, where players are pieces, and captains must anticipate moves and counter-moves. Selecting the right bowlers, altering field placements, and deciding when to attack or defend are key parts of this grand game.

Each format of cricket demands a unique approach. In T20 matches, with their adrenaline-pumping pace, the strategy is often about aggressive play and seizing momentum from the first ball.

ODI cricket, with its 50-over format, offers a balance, mixing aggression with patience, requiring teams to pace their innings carefully.

Test cricket, celebrated for its depth, is like a marathon where endurance and strategy unfold over five days. Captains have the daunting task of devising plans that adapt as the game progresses, including when to declare, which bowlers to rotate, and how to exploit pitch conditions and weather.
