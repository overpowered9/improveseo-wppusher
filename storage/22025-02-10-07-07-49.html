Picture your child at the starting blocks of a sprint—each second counts, and every move must be precise. Similar to how athletes train under race conditions, students preparing for the ACT benefit from practicing with timed tests. This technique is not just about answering questions; it’s about developing the rhythm and pace needed to excel on the actual test day.

Atherton’s ACT tutors emphasize the importance of timed practice because it helps students get accustomed to the pressure of the clock. This familiarity reduces panic and enhances the ability to think clearly under stress.

Moreover, experiencing the real pace of the ACT enables students to identify their strengths and see where they need to adjust their timing strategy. Maybe they need to speed up reading sections or slow down to ensure accuracy in math problems. With practice, these time management skills become second nature, boosting both efficiency and confidence.
